# Applied-Machine-Learning: Customer Segmentation

The goal of this project is to divide customer population into different groups, where customers in each group are most similar to each other using unsupervisd machin learning algorithms. I preformed clustering algorithms to divide customers and analyze each cluster. This is useful for businesses to target advsertising to customers based on their preferences and provide better customer service.

The project walks you through what and why each step is doing including the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model application. This project utilizes PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and different clustering algorithms.
